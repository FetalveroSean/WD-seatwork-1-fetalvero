🎵 Music Album Webpage - HTML Project
This is a simple static webpage built using HTML and CSS. It showcases a personal music taste gallery that features different artists and their albums, including some of their best songs. The layout is divided into five sections, each with a unique header and footer styling, and includes responsive elements such as styled buttons and interactive menus.
